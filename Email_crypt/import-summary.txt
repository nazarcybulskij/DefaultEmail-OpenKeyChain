ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Android.mk

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => emailcommon/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => emailcommon/src/main/res/
* src/ => emailcommon/src/main/java/
* src/com.indeema.emailcommon/provider/Account.aidl => emailcommon/src/main/aidl/com.indeema.emailcommon/provider/Account.aidl
* src/com.indeema.emailcommon/provider/HostAuth.aidl => emailcommon/src/main/aidl/com.indeema.emailcommon/provider/HostAuth.aidl
* src/com.indeema.emailcommon/provider/Policy.aidl => emailcommon/src/main/aidl/com.indeema.emailcommon/provider/Policy.aidl
* src/com.indeema.emailcommon/service/IAccountService.aidl => emailcommon/src/main/aidl/com.indeema.emailcommon/service/IAccountService.aidl
* src/com.indeema.emailcommon/service/IEmailService.aidl => emailcommon/src/main/aidl/com.indeema.emailcommon/service/IEmailService.aidl
* src/com.indeema.emailcommon/service/IEmailServiceCallback.aidl => emailcommon/src/main/aidl/com.indeema.emailcommon/service/IEmailServiceCallback.aidl
* src/com.indeema.emailcommon/service/IPolicyService.aidl => emailcommon/src/main/aidl/com.indeema.emailcommon/service/IPolicyService.aidl
* src/com.indeema.emailcommon/service/SearchParams.aidl => emailcommon/src/main/aidl/com.indeema.emailcommon/service/SearchParams.aidl

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
